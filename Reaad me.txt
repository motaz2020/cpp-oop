C++ Project Description Fall’20 
One of the functions of the Learning Management System (LMS) is to provide 
teachers with tools to view and analyze students’ grades. The aim of this exercise 
is to import students’ data and perform some statistical operations such as 
normalization and transform them into symbol grades representation. The 
program should have a menu of the following functions: 
• Import/export student data... • Import/export 
student grade 
• Modify grades: 
o Normalize 
o export GPA grades 
The implementation of the project can be done in following parts: 
Part 1: 
The file “studentsData.csv” contains the data of the students represented as 
columns. Use this file to create an array that holds the students’ information (ID, 
Name, Age, Gender, etc..). You can either represent the data as a 
Multidimensional array or an Array of Objects (of course you would first have to 
create the Student Class first). 
Part 2: 
The file “studentsGrades.csv” contains the student’s grades for five different 
courses. All the grades are marked out of 100. Write a function to normalize the 
results of each course. The function takes the raw data as input, calculates the 
mean and standard deviation and then computes the normalized data. Use the 
following equations to normalize the data: 
𝑥−𝜇
𝑜 = 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒: 
𝜎
𝜇: is the mean of the grades in the course 𝜎:
Standard deviation of the grades 
Part 3: 
Replace the students’ grades with grades symbols according to the following 
table: 
Range Symbol
≥ 90 A
90 < 85 B+
80 < 85 B
75 < 80 C+
70 < 75 C
65 < 70 D+
60 < 65 D
60 F
Then export the modified data to a CSV file. 
Part 4: 
Write a function that provides statistics for every grade band for each course. For 
example, in the Maths(1) course: 10% of the students got A, 20% got B, 40% got C 
and so on. 
Part 5: 
Write a function that prints a student’s basic information and grades given the 
student’s ID.

Deliverables: 
Students are encouraged to work in groups of four individuals. Each group should 
submit the following a compressed file containing the following deliverables: 
• Source code files. (Project folder) 
• In case of a group submission: A text file which contains the contribution of 
each member of the group (What did each member do?). 
• A report in one PDF file containing: 
1. Flow charts of the main flow of the program. 
2. Screenshots of the program while running.
